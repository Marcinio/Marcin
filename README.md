    <h1>Why did I make this website?</h1>
       <p>I made this website as a project for my ELA class. Our teacher found inspiration in the website browser Google's "Genius Hour" where they let their employees work on whatever they want 20% of the time, so our teacher gave us 20% of our period one day a week to work on anything we'd like. I personally chose a website as I already had much experience in the JavaScript coding language.</p>
